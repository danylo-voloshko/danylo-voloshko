## Hi, I'm Danylo 👋

I have a technical background (TUKE) and a strong analytical mindset.
I work on automation and data-driven analysis, and I like building simple, reliable tooling that helps validate results and improve workflows.

### Strengths
- Analytical thinking, attention to detail, process optimization
- Python scripts for automation (data/logs/report processing, metrics, small tools)
- Testing mindset: validating inputs/outputs, negative scenarios, clear bug reporting

### Featured project
- **FastAPI File Service + QA artifacts**: https://github.com/danylo-voloshko/fastapi-file-service

### Location
Slovakia
